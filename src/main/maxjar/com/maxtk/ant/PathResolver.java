/**
 * <p>
 * 
 * A PathResolver is used for each component of the classpath.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * 
 * Each type of component is a specialization of this base class. For example, a
 * jar file encountered in the classpath causes a JarResolver to be
 * instantiated. A JarResolver knows how to search within jar files for specific
 * files.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * 
 * This approach is taken for two reasons:
 * <ol>
 * <li>To encapsulate the specifics of fetching streams and what attributes are
 * set on a jar entry's manifest entry.</li>
 * <li>To provide an association between the <i>source</i> of a class (or
 * resource) and the repository from which it came. This info is priceless when
 * trying to figure out why the wrong classes are being included in your jar.</li>
 * </ol>
