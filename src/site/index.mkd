## Java Project Build Toolkit

Moxie is a collection of [Ant](http://ant.apache.org) tasks to facilitate building Java projects.  It's purpose is to bring some of the convenience of [Maven](http://maven.apache.org) and [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org) to Ant.  
The Moxie binaries and this site are built with Moxie.

### Core Package (100KB)

The core package includes `mx:init` for project setup & dependency retrieval, and `mx:report` to create a text report about your transitive dependencies and their licenses.

Bundled with the core package is a private copy of the [AntContrib](http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net) *if* task (included as `mx:if`) and a partial subset of [jansi](http://jansi.fusesource.org), to optionally liven-up your console.

The core package has no external dependencies.

### Pro Package (180KB)

The pro package builds on the core package by adding a Maven-ish set of targets (*moxie.compile, moxie.test, etc*) and tasks to handle compiling your sources, packaging your compiled code, and installing artifacts into your local Moxie repository.


Also included in the pro package are Git tasks to grab the hash id of the checked-out of your project and a task to update a *ghpages* branch for [Github](http://www.github.com) or [Gitblit](http://gitblit.com).

The git tasks depend on [JGit](http://eclipse.org/jgit) which is resolved automatically either from your local Maven repository, your local Moxie repository, or MavenCentral.

### All Package (360KB)

The all package includes the pro package plus `mx:doc`, the Moxie site/document-generation tool.

The `mx:doc` task generates a project site or project documentation from markdown source files.  It depends on [MarkdownPapers](http://markdown.tautua.org) and [Rhino](http://www.mozilla.org/rhino), which are resolved automatically either from your local Maven repository, your local Moxie repository, or MavenCentral.  It also incorporates a private copy of [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap), [GoogleCode Prettify](https://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify), and a partial subset of [lesscss-engine](http://www.asual.com/lesscss) to allow customization of the look of your documentation.
